                <h2>Istanbulites moving to safer neighboring cities over quake risk

                </h2>
                <p>The Feb. 6 earthquakes that killed more than 45,000 people sent a shockwave across the country,
                    especially Istanbul, where experts have long warned of a possible massive earthquake, forcing
                    Istanbulites to move to safer neighboring provinces, such as Kırklareli and Edirne.

                    Following the devastating earthquakes affecting the country’s southern provinces, a possible severe
                    earthquake expected in Istanbul has come back on the agenda.



                </p>
                <p>Though many solutions have been proposed to protect the metropolis, where almost 16 million people
                    live, some residents have turned their route to safer cities.

                </p>
                <p>Currently, there is a great demand for the neighboring provinces of Kırklareli and Edirne, which are
                    earthquake-safe according to the Türkiye Fault Lines Map prepared by Türkiye’s Disaster and
                    Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD).

                </p>
                <p>Ümit İkizlerli, a representative of the real estate sector in Kırklareli, stated that the number of
                    customers coming from Istanbul on weekends has increased almost eightfold.</p>
                <p>He added that incoming customers first give priority to land purchases and formulas, such as
                    prefabricated houses, tiny houses, or caravans. </p>
                <p>According to a website, ekonomim.com, sector representatives of moving companies stated the number of
                    people leaving Istanbul in the last 10 days is at the peak of 20 years.

                    It was stated that in addition to the safe surrounding provinces, there were many people who moved
                    to their summer houses in the Aegean provinces.

                    As some people do not take their belongings when they leave the city, due to moving to smaller
                    houses, there is also a great demand for warehouses.</p>
                <p>Istanbulites who did not prefer to move to other cities have started to search for houses in safer
                    districts of the city.

                    Residents of many districts such as Kadıköy, Avcılar, Beylikdüzü, Bağcılar and Sefaköy, where old
                    buildings are located and whose grounds are not appropriate for tremors are willing to move to safer
                    districts such as Sarıyer and Beykoz.</p>
                <p>Ali Aymazdır, an official from an association of moving companies, pointed out they received a lot of
                    relocation requests in Istanbul, especially from the European side.

                    “There is a demand for Istanbul’s district close to the Black Sea, mostly from the Beylikdüzü,
                    Avcılar, Bağcılar and Sefaköy districts,” Aymazdır stated.</p>
