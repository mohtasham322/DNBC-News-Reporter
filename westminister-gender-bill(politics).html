                </span><hr>
                <p><b>The Westminster government's decision to use powers to override Scotland's Gender Recognition Reform (GRR) Bill, passed under the devolved administration, has triggered an almighty constitutional row.

                </b>Ministers have confirmed they will use a Section 35 order to block the Scottish government's gender recognition reform legislation citing concerns over its impact on UK-wide legislation.

            </p>
            <p>The legislation, which was passed by MSPs last month, seeks to make it easier for trans people to legally change their gender but there are concerns that it clashes with the Equality Act, a reserved piece of legislation.

            </p>
            <p>Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has now said he will make a section 35 order under the Scotland Act to prevent the legislation receiving royal assent. It is the first time the power has been used in its history. 

            </p>
            <p>The Scottish government legislation was passed by MSPs with cross-party backing before Christmas after years of consultation and debate.

            </p>
            <p>Passage of the legislation was met with concerns from critics of the bill that it is ill-defined and its impacts on the UK-wide Equality Act have not been fully considered.

            </p>
            <p>Now the UK government has blocked the Scottish bill's passage into law, there could be major political consequences.

            </p>


                
                
                <span class="inside_magazines_small_heading">How can the UK government intervene?
                </span>

                <img class="w-100" src="picture folder/politics/scotland-gender-bill2.webp" alt=""><br>
                <span class="magazine_heading_description">The Gender Reform Bill was originally passed in Holyrood, the Scottish devolved parliament (Alamy)
                </span><hr>
                <p>Scotland Secretary Alister Jack raised the possibility of a Westminster challenge as soon as the bill was passed in late December. 

                </p>
                <p>"We share the concerns that many people have regarding certain aspects of this bill, and in particular the safety issues for women and children," he said at the time. 

                </p>
                <p>"We will look closely at that, and also the ramifications for the 2010 Equality Act and other UK-wide legislation in the coming weeks – up to and including a Section 35 order stopping the bill going for royal assent if necessary."

                </p>
                <p>The order he refers to is part of the Scotland Act and gives the Secretary of State the "power to intervene in certain cases".

                </p>
                <p>It allows Jack to order the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament not to send the GRR bill to the King for royal assent, therefore preventing it from becoming an Act of Parliament and becoming law.

                </p>
                <span class="inside_magazines_small_heading">When has this ever happened before?
                </span>
                <p>The answer to that is never – the measure was included as an emergency option, and there has not so far been cause to employ it. If Jack does so now, he is making political history and pushing our politics into untested waters.

                </p>
                <p>The gender recognition reform bill has already proved contentious, meaning there will also be questions around the politics of using the nuclear option of section 35 for the first time in relation to this issue. 

                </p>


                <img class="w-100" src="picture folder/politics/scotland-gender-bill3.webp" alt=""><br>
                <span class="inside_magazines_small_heading">Why has the UK government decided to block the bill?
                </span>
                <p>The UK government has decided that the Holyrood bill makes changes to the law "as it applies to reserved matters" which it believes "would have an adverse effect on the operation of the law as it applies to reserved matters".

                </p>
                <p>That's where the Equality Act 2010 comes in. Set in Westminster and applied across the UK, it is legislation that the Scottish Parliament does not have the legal powers to change. 

                </p>
                <p>The Scottish government has said the GRR Bill is competent and does not create such a circumstance.

                </p>
                <p>However, the Secretary of State for Scotland disagrees, and Jack has now said he will make a section 35 order under the Scotland Act to prevent the legislation receiving royal assent.

                </p>
