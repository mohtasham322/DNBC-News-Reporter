                <span class="magazine_heading_description">SNP leadership hopeful Kate Forbes with Nicola Sturgeon (Alamy)
                </span><hr>
                <p><b>Kate Forbes and Humza Yousaf are among the top names who have formally declared their intention to run to become Scottish National Party leader and First Minister of Scotland after Nicola Sturgeon resigned from the job last week.
                </b></p>
                
                <p>Candidates have until Friday to reach the threshold of 100 nominations from at least local branches, and a new leader will be confirmed on 27 March.

                </p>
                <p>Unlike the prominent role played by MPs in Westminster's recent Conservative Party leadership elections, all SNP hopefuls who hit the threshold will automatically be put on the ballot with every party member being given a vote on who they wish to take the top job.

                </p>
                <p>Sturgeon herself has said her party had an "array of talent" ready to replace her –  but with several senior party figures ruling themselves out of the race, who is still in the running to become the next leader in Scotland?

                </p>

                <span class="inside_magazines_small_heading">Humza Yousaf
                </span>
                <p>A prominent figure since his election in 2011, Yousaf has been seen for several years as a potential candidate for the SNP's top job.

                </p>
                <p>Launching his leadership bid on Sunday, he said: "You've got to put yourself forward if you think you're the best person for the job. And I do. This is the top job in the country, and it needs somebody who has experience."

                </p>
                <p>That experience includes several long stints in senior cabinet positions, including previously as Scotland's justice minister and now as health secretary. But Yousaf has been dogged by negative headlines during his time in the roles, with his record of handling of Scotland's NHS leading to repeated calls from opposition parties for his resignation.

                </p>

                <img class="w-100" src="picture folder/politics/snp-leader2.webp" alt=""><br>
                <span class="magazine_heading_description">Health Secretary Humza Yousaf
                </span><hr>

                <p>With a significant media profile, Yousaf is viewed as a close ally of Sturgeon's, leading to concerns that he would act as a continuity leader who would stick with both Sturgeon's current independence strategy and retaining the controversial gender reforms, both of which are believed to have significantly contributed to her weakened position ahead of her resignation. 

                </p>
                <p>But Yousaf has already secured the support of prominent colleagues, with SNP culture minister Neil Gray – who was touted as a potential leadership hopeful – saying he was not planning to stand and would instead be throwing his backing behind Yousaf.

                <span class="inside_magazines_small_heading">Ash Regan
                </span>
                <p>The second MSP to have formally declared their leadership ambitions, Regan resigned from Sturgeon's government over the gender self-identification plans and has since become an outspoken critic of the legislation.

                </p>
                <p>A former community safety minister, Regan has the least public profile out of all the declared candidates, but has the most hardline stance on securing independence, claiming that a pro-independence majority at any election should lead to 'Scexit' negotiations.

                </p>

                <img class="w-100" src="picture folder/politics/snp-leader3.webp" alt=""><br>
                <span class="magazine_heading_description">Ash Regan has announced her bid after resigning from Sturgeon's government.
                </span><hr>
                <p>Alongside her pitch to treat any Holyrood or Westminster election as a de-facto independence referendum, a controversial position also pushed by Sturgeon, Regan also pledged to call for a fresh independence convention to "create a new vision of an independent Scotland".

                </p>
                <p>While Regan's strong stance on independence might appeal to certain wings of the party, her opposition to the gender reform legislation could cause friction if she was elected, with the Scottish Greens suggesting the policy was a red line which if breached could force them to scrap the Bute House Agreement – the formal coalition between the two parties – meaning the SNP may not have enough votes to elect their new leader as First Minister.

                </p>
