                <p>In a boost to the depleting foreign exchange reserves, cash-strapped Pakistan has received $500 million from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC), Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue Ishaq Dar confirmed late Friday.

                </p>
                <p>The cash-strapped country has faced growing economic challenges, with high inflation, sliding forex reserves, a widening current account deficit, and a depreciating currency.

                </p>
                <p>"Formalities completed [and] Chinese Bank, ICBC approved rollover of $1.3 billion facility which has been repaid by Pakistan to ICBC in recent months," the finance czar announced on Twitter.

                </p>
                <p>He said that the facility would be disbursed in three instalments, first one of $500 million has been received by the State Bank of Pakistan.

                </p>
                <p>"It will increase forex reserves!" Dar added.

Facility will be disbursed in 3 instalments, first one of US$500 million has been received by SBP. It will increase forex reserves!</p>&mdash; Ishaq Dar (@MIshaqDar50) <a href="https://twitter.com/MIshaqDar50/status/1631725209077129220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
                <p>Foreign exchange reserves were at $3.8 billion as of February 24, just enough for less than a month of imports. While the liquid foreign exchange reserves held by the country stand at around $9 billion which include $5.5 billion net reserves held by commercial banks.

                </p>
                <p>Hours before his announcement, the finance minister revealed that China has renewed a facility under which Pakistan expected an additional inflow of $500 million in the “next few days”.

                </p>
                <p>Highlighting the PDM-led government’s economic achievements, Dar said that the foreign exchange reserves held by the SBP climbed to $3.8 billion from $2.8 billion — recorded last month. He maintained that the government returned $6.5 billion of foreign debt during the current fiscal year.

                </p>
                <p>Pakistan has made payments of around $5.5 billion (excluding the $1 billion sukuk payment). These include $2 billion to China Development Bank and ICBC and $3.5 billion have been given to banks in other countries,” he said.

                </p>
                <p>“Debt is usually rolled over but the debt stock does not reduce. We are reducing debt stock,” he said. “Formalities with ICBC were completed last night. We returned $1.3 billion to it and this facility has been renewed and we will receive the amount back in three tranches.

                </p>
                <p>“We paid back $1.3 billion in three tranches — $500 million, $500 million and $300 million. We will receive it back the same way. Pakistan will get $500 million in two-three days. We might receive it on Monday. Then we will get an additional $500 million in 10 days.”
