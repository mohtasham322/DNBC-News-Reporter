                <h2>A 50% rent increase? Record property demand in Dubai is creating a nightmare for some residents</h2>
                <br>
                <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Demand for property in the United Arab Emirates’ glitzy commercial
                    capital of Dubai hit a record high for the first two months of 2023, real estate services firm CBRE
                    revealed in a report published Thursday.</p>

                <p>  In February alone, Dubai’s residential market saw 8,515 transactions — a whopping 43.9% increase
                    from the previous year. January and February together clocked a total of 17,741 residential
                    transactions.</p> 

                 <p>  Beyond the property market, Dubai’s economic boom is evident in everyday life.</p> 

                   <p> Every week, a new high-end restaurant seems to appear in the desert emirate, which morphed from a
                    small fishing village to a bustling, hyper-modern metropolis within just the last few decades.
                    Downtown bars are crowded most evenings. The city’s Roads and Traffic Authority recently reported
                    record road traffic and public transport use in the last year. Residents frequently complain that
                    ordering a taxi on any evening of the week — even a Monday night — takes longer than ever.</p>

                  <p>  But while some Dubai residents — roughly 90% of whom are expats — find the struggle to book a ride
                    or a restaurant table frustrating, it’s the sharp and often extreme increase in rents that are
                    hitting many of them the hardest.</p>

                   <p>“A 60% increase,” one Dubai-based consultant told CNBC when asked about how much their rent had
                    increased year-on-year. The consultant, who was living in Dubai’s high-end financial district, the
                    DIFC, decided to relocate instead of paying the new rent. Several other DIFC residents reported
                    landlords asking for rent increases of 50% and higher, and many of those have downsized or moved to
                    less expensive areas as a result.</p>
