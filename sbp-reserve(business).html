                <p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)-held forex reserves moved above $4 billion after the liquidity-challenged country received $500 million in loan from a Chinese bank.

                </p>
                <p>In a statement, the central bank said that its foreign exchange reserves have increased by $487 million to $4,301 million as of the week ended March 3, which will provide an import cover of around a month.

                </p>
                <p>The SBP received $500 million last week from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) as part of the institution's $1.3 billion facility, just days after it had received $700 million from the China Development Bank.

                </p>
                <p>Pakistan hasn't received funds from any friendly country except for China as the $350 billion economy struggles to revive the stalled International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.

                </p>
                <p>Cash-strapped Pakistan has been trying to secure the IMF bailout to avert a debt default, unlock more funding and stave off severe supply shortages. There are $7 billion of repayments in the coming months, including a Chinese loan of $2 billion due in March, according to Fitch Ratings.

                </p>
                <p>The nation needs to repay about $3 billion dues in the upcoming payments while $4 billion is expected to be rolled over, SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad said in an analyst briefing after the announcement of the monetary policy rate — which has been jacked by to a 27-year high of 20%.

                </p>
                <p>But as the IMF deal sees a dealy, the Pakistan rupee has plunged to historic lows and closed at 282.30 against the dollar in the interbank market — and if all goes well for Pakistan in the coming days, experts believe that the local currency can only recover to 265.

                </p>
                <p>In his address to an event earlier on Thursday, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said that the IMF was "satisfied" with Pakistan's actions, but the staff-level agreement could not be signed this week.

                </p>
                <p>"We seem to be very close to signing the staff-level agreement hopefully in the next few days," Dar said in his address during a seminar titled "Reviving Economic Stability through the Strengthening of Public Financial Management" in the federal capital.

                </p>
                <p>Due to a shortage of dollars, the government has also imposed restrictions on imports — resulting in the partial closure of not only textile but automobile manufacturers as well, prompting unemployment fears.

                </p>
