                <h2>Trump invited to testify before NY grand jury, lawyer says

                </h2>
                <p>Former President Donald Trump has been invited to testify before a New York grand jury that has been
                    investigating hush money payments made on his behalf during his 2016 presidential campaign,
                    according to one of his lawyers.
                </p>
                <p>Trump attorney Joseph Tacopina confirmed Thursday that the Manhattan district attorney’s office has
                    invited the former president to testify next week as prosecutors near a decision on whether to
                    proceed with what could be the first criminal case ever brought against a former U.S. president.

                </p>
                <p>“To me, it’s much ado about nothing,” Tacopina told the Associated Press, adding he didn’t think
                    prosecutors had committed “one way or another” on a decision on whether to charge Trump. He said
                    there was no legal basis for a case.

                </p>
                <p>“It’s just another example of them weaponizing the justice system against him. And it’s sort of
                    unfair,” he said.

                    The office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, declined to comment. Such an
                    invitation to testify before a grand jury often indicates a decision on indictments is near.

                    The invitation to testify was first reported by The New York Times.

                    Any indictment would come as Trump is ramping up a run to regain the White House in 2024 while
                    simultaneously battling legal problems on multiple fronts.</p>
                <p>Trump, in a lengthy statement posted on his social media network, blasted the investigation as a
                    “political Witch-Hunt trying to take down the leading candidate, by far, in the Republican Party”
                    and what he called a “corrupt, depraved, and weaponized justice system.”

                    “I did absolutely nothing wrong,” he said.

                    Meanwhile, the district attorney in Atlanta, Georgia, has said decisions are “imminent” in a
                    two-year investigation into possible illegal meddling in the 2020 election by Trump and his allies.
                    A U.S. Justice Department special counsel is also investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to
                    undo the election as well as the handling of classified documents at his Florida estate.

                    The New York grand jury has been probing Trump’s involvement in a $130,000 payment made in 2016 to
                    the porn star Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public about a sexual encounter she said she had
                    with the Republican years earlier.

                    The money was paid out of the personal funds of Trump’s now-estranged lawyer, Michael Cohen, who
                    then said he was reimbursed by the Trump Organization and also paid extra bonuses for a total that
                    eventually rose to $420,000.

                    Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges in 2018 that the payment, and another he helped arrange to
                    the model Karen McDougal through the parent company of the National Enquirer tabloid, amounted to an
                    illegal campaign contribution.

                    Federal prosecutors at the time decided not to bring charges against Trump, who by then was
                    president. The Manhattan district attorney’s office then launched its own investigation, which
                    lingered for several years but has been gathering momentum in recent weeks.

                    Several figures close to Trump have been spotted in recent days entering Bragg’s office for meetings
                    with prosecutors, including his former political adviser Kellyanne Conway and former spokesperson
                    Hope Hicks.

                    Cohen has also met several times with prosecutors, saying after a recent visit that he thought the
                    investigation was nearing a conclusion.

                    Under New York law, people who appear before a grand jury are given immunity from prosecution for
                    things they say during their testimony, so potential targets of criminal investigations are
                    generally invited to testify only if they waive that immunity. Lawyers generally advise clients not
                    to do so if there is a potential for a criminal case.

                    It isn’t clear what charges prosecutors might be exploring.

                    Legal experts have said one potential crime could be the way the payments to Cohen were structured
                    and falsely classified internally as being for a legal retainer. New York has a law against
                    falsifying business records, but it is a misdemeanor unless the records fudging is done in
                    conjunction with a more serious felony crime.

                    Tacopina said there was no crime.

                    “There’s no precedent for this. There’s no established case law on this campaign finance stuff. It’s
                    ridiculous. And there’s no underlying crime,” he said.

                    Separately, the district attorney’s office has also spent years investigating whether Trump and his
                    company inflated the value of some its assets in dealings with lenders and potential business
                    partners. Those allegations are the subject of a civil lawsuit, filed by the state’s attorney
                    general.</p>
