        <h2>Teenager killed and five others injured in crash on Long Island, New York
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>A teenager was killed and five others were injured in a crash on Long Island last weekend.

          The two-vehicle collision occurred at Port Jefferson Station, at the intersection of Nesconset Highway and
          Woodhull Avenue, at around 9.30pm on Saturday, March 11.

          Suffolk County Police Department said an 18-year-old was driving a 2019 Honda Accord eastbound on Nesconset
          Highway when he attempted to turn left onto Woodhull Avenue and was hit in the intersection by a 2022 Ford
          Bronco traveling westbound.

          A 16-year-old who was a backseat passenger of the Honda was killed in the crash.

          Police said the 19-year-old driver of the Ford, the driver of the Honda and three teenage passengers in the
          Honda were all hospitalized.

          Their injuries are believed to be non-life-threatening, police added.

          Detectives are investigating the circumstances surrounding the crash.</p>
