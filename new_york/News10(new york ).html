                <h2>Jury mulls death penalty or life for man in New York City bike path attack

                </h2>
                <p>A New York jury began deliberating Wednesday whether to impose the death penalty or grant life in
                    prison to a man convicted of killing eight individuals on a Manhattan bike path five years ago in a
                    terrorist attack.

                </p>
                <p>The same jury of 12 that convicted Sayfullo Saipov in late January in the Halloween 2017 rampage began considering his fate after U.S. District Judge Vernon S. Broderick read them the legal rules they must follow to reach a decision. After about 2 1/2 hours of deliberations, jurors were sent home and told to return Thursday.

                </p>
                <p>They had deliberated only 10 minutes Wednesday when the jury foreperson sent a note to the judge asking whether the panel can discuss that lethal injection is the current U.S. death penalty method and that thereâ€™s currently a moratorium on federal executions.
