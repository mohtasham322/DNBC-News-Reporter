                <h2>Yonkers St Patrick's Day 2023: Where to park and best places to view the McLean Avenue parade

                </h2>
                <p>The countdown to St Patrick's Day has well and truly started, with just days to go.

                    And the day after the big day comes another big event - the annual Yonkers St Patrick's Day parade,
                    which kicks off at 1pm on Saturday, March 18.

                    The parade, which is held on McLean Avenue each year, attracts around 30,000 visitors to the city,
                    with people staying long into the night to enjoy the festivities at the many nearby Irish pubs.

                    Although there are many transport links to the Woodlawn area, there are plenty of places to park
                    nearby on the day of the parade. However, if choosing this option, prepare to arrive early to make
                    sure you get a spot.

                    On the day of the parade, there will be free parking at Empire City Casino. Use the Yonkers Avenue
                    entrance of the Empire City Casino for free shuttles to the parade route</p>
