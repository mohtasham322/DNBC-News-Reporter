                    A former public school employee in Yonkers has been charged with public lewdness offenses.
                </p>
                <p>Police said 57-year-old Rafael Pena, a resident of the city, allegedly "exposed his intimate parts" to a 58-year-old woman on February 28 at an office of the Yonkers Police Athletic League on North Broadway.

                </p>
                <p>The incident took place in a rented private office with no other people present.

                </p>
                <p>The incident was not visible outside the office, police added.

                </p>
                <p>Pena was a program specialist for the Yonkers Public Schools, meaning he assisted in the planning and implementation of community-service programs.
