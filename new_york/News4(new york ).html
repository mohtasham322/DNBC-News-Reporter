                <h2>Watch: Passengers on Aer Lingus flight to New York treated to live seisiún on board
                </h2>
                <p>Long-haul flights can often be a dull affair, but one journey across the Atlantic was made infinitely
                    better this weekend when a group of talented musicians treated passengers to an authentic seisiún on
                    board.

                    It all unfolded on an Aer Lingus flight on Saturday morning from Dublin to New York JFK.

                    A video showing passengers enjoying the music was shared on Reddit, where it’s racked up more than
                    40,000 upvotes, or likes.
                </p>
                <p>The original poster of the video, Reddit user @dmartin716, said that the music session started up
                    after the plane had landed while people were waiting to get off.

                    In the clip, passengers can be seen standing up and gathering around a group of trad musicians, who
                    were in full flow on the fiddle, accordion and tin whistle.

                    One passenger can be heard joking: “We wasted a lot of time on the flight!” - suggesting that he
                    would’ve liked the music to kick off earlier as some in-flight entertainment</p>
