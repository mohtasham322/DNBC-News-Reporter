                <h2>Man stabbed after dispute at Lexington Avenue station in New York
                </h2>

                <p>A man has been stabbed after a dispute at a train station in New York.

                    At around 12.20am on Saturday, March 4, a man was engaged in a dispute with four individuals at 59th
                    Street-Lexington Avenue station in Manhattan.

                    A physical altercation ensued from this, and one of the individuals stabbed the victim with a knife,
                    according to police.

                    He was standing on the southbound 4 train subway platform at the time. The victim was taken to the
                    hospital in stable condition.

                    The NYPD has since released images of four suspects wanted in relation to this incident.

                    Three of the four are shown on CCTV wearing dark clothing, with one wearing a blue North Face coat.
