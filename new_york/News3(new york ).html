                <h2>Tánaiste Micheál Martin travels to New York and Boston for St Patrick’s Day engagements
                </h2>
                <br>
                <p>Tánaiste Micheál Martin is to travel to the US today to take part in St Patrick's Day celebrations in
                    New York and Boston.

                    The Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, who was the Taoiseach until changing roles
                    before Christmas, is one of 36 Irish representatives going to cities in more than 41 countries for
                    the holiday.

                    St Patrick's Day is a key date in the Irish diplomatic calendar, and the government says cultural
                    promotion is central to plans around the holiday. More than 850 official events are taking place
                    around the world this year.

                    Mr Martin's schedule for New York includes meetings with clients of Enterprise Ireland and the Irish
                    Development Authority, as well as other US and Irish business leaders.

                    He's also slated to attend several events with members of the Irish community in New York.

                    This year's events with political leaders in the US will be largely dominated by the 25th
                    anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.

                    The Tánaiste's office said a Good Friday Agreement event will take place in every city visited by a
                    minister, including in New York on Monday evening.</p>
                <p>On Tuesday, he's also expected to attend a reception to launch an annual report by the American
                    Chamber of Commerce in Ireland.</p>
                <p>His schedule on Wednesday includes some high-level engagements at the United Nations, along with a
                    visit to the New York Irish Centre, a Seniors Lunch, and a reception with members of New York's
                    Irish community.

                    That evening, the Tánaiste will attend the St Patrick’s Day Foundation Annual Gala.

                    On Thursday, Mr Martin will be ringing the opening bell at the NASDAQ with other key players from
                    the city's St Patrick's Day parade, like the Grand Marsal and the president of the parade - an event
                    that will be shown on screen in Times Square.

                    Thursday's plan also includes a lunch at the Ireland US Council and the Irish Funds Conference.

                    On Friday, St Patrick's Day, the Tánaiste will take part in the New York City St Patrick's Day
                    parade, followed by a performance that evening by the Cross Border Orchestra in Carnegie Hall.</p>
                <p>On Saturday, Tánaiste Micheál Martin will go to Boston to address a John F Kennedy Library event
                    marking a few milestones - St Patrick’s Day, the anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and the
                    60th anniversary of President Kennedy’s visit to Ireland.

                    Next Sunday, Mr Martin is due to meet Congressman Richie Neale in Holyoke, before taking part in the
                    Holyoke St Patrick’s Day parade.

                    Claire Cronin, the US Ambassador to Ireland, is also due to be presented with the Holyoke St
                    Patrick’s Day Ambassador Award at the event.

                    The award is aimed at honoring the work of someone who promotes the relationship between the people
                    of Ireland and the United States.</p>
