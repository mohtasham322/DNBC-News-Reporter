        <h2>Yonkers police say fatal fire caused by 'marijuana growing apparatus'
        </h2>
        <p>Police in Yonkers have said the likely cause of a fatal fire in the area last week was "marijuana growing
          apparatus".

          Shortly before 1am on Wednesday, March 8, Yonkers First Responders including Fire, Police, and EMS responded
          to reports of a residential building fire at 671 Bronx River Road, a seven-story 95-unit housing cooperative.

          When they arrived, members of the Yonkers Fire and Police Department immediately began rescue, firefighting,
          traffic and crowd control operations.

          Residents were evacuated, and approximately 65 persons were sheltered in the Scotti Community Center north of
          the fire scene with the assistance of the Office of Emergency Management and other City agencies.</p>
        <p>
          Fire Departments from other jurisdictions assisted with mutual aid to combat the general alarm fire which was
          brought under control hours later.

          Dozens of firefighters and several residents suffered non-life-threatening injuries. However, sadly, a
          67-year-old male resident of the 4th floor, named by police as Michael Damiano, died as a result of injuries
          caused by the blaze.

          An investigation into the cause of the fire found it likely started in a first floor apartment, with the
          likely cause and origin being an electric heating lamp used to cultivate six marijuana plants that a resident
          was growing for personal adult use.
