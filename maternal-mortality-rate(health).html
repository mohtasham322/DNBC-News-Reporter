                <p>GENEVA: A woman dies every two minutes due to pregnancy or childbirth complications, despite maternal mortality rates dropping by a third in 20 years, the United Nations said Thursday.

                </p>
                <p>Rates fell significantly between 2000 and 2015 but largely stagnated between 2016 and 2020 -- and in some regions have even reversed, the UN said.

                </p>
                <p>The overall maternal mortality rate dropped by 34.3% over a 20-year period — from 339 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 223 maternal deaths in 2020, according to a report by the World Health Organization and other UN agencies.

                </p>
                <p>Nonetheless, that means nearly 800 women died per day in 2020 — or around one every two minutes.

                </p>
                <p>Belarus recorded the biggest decline — down 95.5% — while Venezuela saw the highest increase. Between 2000 and 2015, the biggest rise was in the United States.

                </p>
                <p>"While pregnancy should be a time of immense hope and a positive experience for all women, it is tragically still a shockingly dangerous experience for millions around the world," said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

                </p>
                <p>"These new statistics reveal the urgent need to ensure every woman and girl has access to critical health services... and that they can fully exercise their reproductive rights."

                </p>
                <p>The report found that between 2016 and 2020, maternal mortality rates dropped in only two of the eight UN regions: in Australia and New Zealand by 35%, and in Central and Southern Asia by 16%.


                </p>


                


                
                <span class="inside_magazines_small_heading">'Unconscionable'</span>
                <p>The rate went up in Europe and Northern America by 17%, and in Latin America and the Caribbean by 15%. Elsewhere, it stagnated.

                </p>
                <p>The two European countries witnessing "significant increases" are Greece and Cyprus, the report's author Jenny Cresswell told journalists.

                </p>
                <p>Maternal deaths remain largely concentrated in the world's poorest regions and in conflict-affected countries.

                </p>
                <p>Around 70% of those deaths recorded in 2020 were in sub-Saharan Africa, where the rate is "136 times bigger" than in Australia and New Zealand, Cresswell said.

                </p>
                <p>In Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — all facing severe humanitarian crises — rates were more than twice the global average.

                </p>
                <p>Severe bleeding, infections, complications from unsafe abortions and underlying conditions such as HIV/AIDS are among the leading causes of death, the report said — which are all largely preventable and treatable.

                </p>
                <p>The WHO said it was "critical" that women had control over their reproductive health — particularly about if and when to have children, so that they can plan and space childbearing to protect their health.

                </p>
                <p>Natalia Kanem, head of the UN Population Fund, said the rate of women "needlessly" dying was "unconscionable".

                </p>
                <p>"We can and must do better by urgently investing in family planning and filling the global shortage of 900,000 midwives," she said.

                </p>
                <p>While the report covers data up to 2020, the WHO's Anshu Banerjee told journalists that the statistics since then look bleak, due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis.

                </p>
