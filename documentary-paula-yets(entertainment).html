                <p>UK network Channel 4 has commissioned a new documentary from Curious Films about TV host and author Paula Yates.

                </p>
                <p>Yates died following a heroin overdose at the age of 41 in 2000. The two-part documentary, titled simply “Paula,” will explore the life of Yates who “frankly and eloquently discusses the positives and pitfalls of her life, “reports the Guardian.

                </p>
                <p>The documentary features four unseen interviews with Yates, recorded in 1998 and 1999, just before her death. It intends to “reveal the real Paula Yates behind the tabloid-driven narrative, drawing on an extraordinary set of never-before-heard interviews, the words of some of those who knew her best and a wealth of archive to tell her story in her own words.”

                </p>
                <p>Yates was a Channel 4 constant with shows like “The Tube” and “The Big Breakfast” for which she interviewed many celebrities including Arnold Schwarzenegger.

                </p>
                <p>“Paula Yates exploded onto our screens in the very first week that Channel 4 came on air in 1982, a whirlwind of wit, verve and charisma – a totally unique style,” said Shaminder Nahal, head of specialist factual at Channel 4. “Looking at what she achieved now, it feels like no-one has ever quite matched her as a TV presenter. So as Channel 4 reflects on 40 years, it feels right to look at her life and career, and what an impact she made. As ever, Curious Films has made a riveting and sensitive series that will, I hope, introduce Paula to a new generation.”

                </p>
                <p>Yates was a popular subject in tabloid press, who are accused of initially promoting and then criticizing her over her disordered lifestyle.
