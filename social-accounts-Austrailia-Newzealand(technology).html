                <p>SYDNEY: Facebook and Instagram began a week-long rollout of their first paid verification service on Friday, testing users' willingness to pay for social media features that until now have been free.

                </p>
                <p>Facing a drop in advertising revenues, parent company Meta is piloting a subscription in Australia and New Zealand before it appears in larger markets. The service will cost US$11.99 on the web and US$14.99 on the iOS and Android mobile platforms.

                </p>
                <p>From Friday, subscribers Down Under who provide government-issued IDs can start applying for a verified badge, offering protection against impersonation, direct access to customer support and more visibility, according to the company.

                </p>
                <p>"We'll be gradually rolling out access to Meta Verified on Facebook and Instagram and expect to reach 100% availability within the first 7 days of the rollout," a Meta spokesperson told AFP.

                </p>
                <p>Some attempts to join Meta Verified from Sydney found the service was not available on the first day of the rollout.

                </p>
                <p>"This new feature is about increasing authenticity and security across our services," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a statement posted on Facebook and Instagram.

                </p>
                <p>Crucially, the move also provides Meta with a way of mining more revenue from its two billion users.

                </p>
                <p>The swelling army of creators, influencers and pseudo-celebrities who make a living online could be obvious users of verification, according to experts.

                </p>
                <p>Many of them complain that it can be difficult to smooth technical and administrative problems, causing delays and lost revenue.

                <span class="inside_magazines_small_heading">'Slow-burning strategy'
                </span>
                <p>Jonathon Hutchinson, a lecturer in online communication at the University of Sydney, said a kind of "VIP service" could be "quite a valuable proposition for a content creator".

                </p>
                <p>But ahead of the launch, ordinary users seemed less than keen to hand over money to a company that already makes vast sums from their data.

                </p>
                <p>"I think most of my friends would laugh at it," said Ainsley Jade, a 35-year-old social media user in Sydney.

                </p>
                <p>She sees a trend toward more casual use of social media and a shift away from a time when you "put your whole life on there".

                </p>
                <p>"I think people are sort of moving away from that... but definitely, definitely wouldn't pay for it — no way!

                </p>
                <p>Some commentators have expressed puzzlement at why Facebook and Instagram would adopt a verification-subscription strategy that rival Twitter tried just weeks ago — with less than stellar results.

                </p>
                <p>But Hutchinson said Meta has often shown a willingness to try new, and at times risky models, only to drop what does not work.

                </p>
                <p>He sees this latest gambit as part of a broader effort to condition users to pay for social media.

                </p>
                <p>"I think it´s part of a slow-burning strategy to move toward a model that is not free, where more and more services and functionality will be a paid or subscription-based service," he told AFP.

                </p>
                <p>"I think over the long-term the functionality that we have now — joining groups, selling things on 'Marketplace'- all of these add-ons that have emerged on Facebook over the years will eventually become subscription-based services."
