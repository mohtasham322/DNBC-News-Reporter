                <p><b>Campaigners have warned that the need for voter ID could cause chaos when it's required for the first time at local elections this May, arguing the change could undermine trust in democracy.

                </b></p>
                <p>The Elections Act 2022, which passed through parliament last year, includes a new demand that adults in the UK show a valid form of photo ID, which can include a passport, driving licence, or special voter ID card that people can now apply for, in order to cast their vote. Previously a person would need simply to be registered to vote, and give their address at the polling station. 

                </p>
                <p>Several pro-democracy organisations including the Electoral Reform Society, Open Britain, Fair Vote, and Unlock Democracy have said the hasty rollout of the new laws could lead to “chaos” at the next elections as many people do not have a valid ID.

                </p>
                <p>There are fears that as many as 2 million voters could be effectively disenfranchised because, according to the Electoral Commission, they do not have a form of ID that would allow them to vote.

                </p>
                <p>The PA news agency reported earlier this week that the Electoral Commission had been given £5.6 million in government funding to launch a public awareness campaign around the new law and obtaining the correct ID, in a bid to tackle this issue.

                </p>

                </span><hr>
                <p>Under the Elections Act 2022, which was first proposed by the government in May 2021, all voters must show photo ID when going to polling stations from 4 May 2023.

                </p>
                <p>The new law applies to all local elections, police and crime commissioner elections, by-elections and recall petitions – a special election to remove an elected representative before the end of their term.

                </p>
                <p>It will also apply to general elections from October 2023, with the next election due to be called before the end of 2024.

                </p>
                <p>Accepted forms of ID include a UK passport, driving licence, an identity card issued under the PASS scheme or an ID card issued by a country in the European Economic Area (EEA). 

                </p>
                <p>Other acceptable documents include a Blue Badge card and certain local travel cards such as an Older Person’s Bus Pass or a Freedom Pass.

                </p>
                <p>Voters must provide original documents, and photocopies or scans will not be accepted at polling stations.

                </p>
                <p>People without any of the accepted forms of ID can apply for a Voter Authority Certificate, with the online application form due to be available from late January 2023.

                </p>
