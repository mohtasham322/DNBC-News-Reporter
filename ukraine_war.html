                <p><b>The US has "formally determined" that Russia had committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine, US
                        Vice-President Kamala Harris has said.</b></p>
                <p>Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Ms Harris accused Russia of "gruesome acts of murder,
                    torture, rape and deportation" since its invasion. </p>
                <p>World leaders at the conference called for long-term support of Ukraine.</p>
                <p>UK PM Rishi Sunak said now was the time to "double down" on military support.</p>
                <p>The prime minister argued that Western allies must start planning for the future security of Ukraine,
                    as well as sending the weapons it needs to defend itself now.</p>
                <p>The conference in Germany comes as the one-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of
                    Ukraine approaches on 24 February.</p>
                <p>Ms Harris told the conference that the perpetrators of alleged Russian crimes in Ukraine must be held
                    to account.</p>
                <p>"Their actions are an assault on our common values and our common humanity," she said.</p>
                <p>The UN defines crimes against humanity as a "widespread or systemic attack" on a particular civilian
                    population.</p>
                <p>Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians during its invasion.</p>
                <p>"In the case of Russia's actions in Ukraine we have examined the evidence, we know the legal
                    standards, and there is no doubt: these are crimes against humanity," Ms Harris, a former
                    prosecutor, told the conference.</p>
                <p>She cited "barbaric and inhumane" atrocities during the war in Ukraine, including the scores of
                    bodies found in Bucha shortly after the invasion and the bombing of a theatre in Mariupol.</p>
                <p>"Let us all agree: on behalf of all the victims, both known and unknown, justice must be served," Ms
                    Harris said.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 15px; color: gray;">Evidence grows of civilian killings in Bucha</p>
                    <p>Crimes against humanity are tried at the International Criminal Court (ICC).</p>
                    <p>But the ICC has no powers to arrest suspects and can only exercise jurisdiction within countries which signed up to the agreement that set up the court.</p>
                    <p>Russia is not a signatory to that agreement, so it is unlikely to extradite any suspects.</p>
                    <p>The three-day gathering in Munich will provide a key test of Western support for Kyiv as both sides in the war prepare for spring offensives.</p>
                    <p>Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Moscow had "waged a genocidal war" because it did not think Ukrainians "deserve to exist as a sovereign nation".</p>
                    <p>Tens of thousands have lost their lives and millions have been forced from their homes as part of Vladimir Putin's invasion.</p>
