                <p>MOSCOW: Moscow said Monday that Apple had paid off a 906 million ruble ($12.1 million) fine imposed by Russian courts that accused it of abusing its market position.

                </p>
                <p>The Kremlin in recent years has isolated Russia from Western tech giants that it believes pose a threat to Moscow’s ability to control the distribution of information among Russians.

                </p>
                <p>"Apple paid a 906 million-ruble anti-trust fine," Russia’s Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) said, confirming authorities received the funds.

                </p>
                <p>Apple suspended sales of its products in Russia shortly after the Kremlin deployed troops to Ukraine in February last year.

                </p>
                <p>The case against Apple was initiated by Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity firm, which was deemed a national security threat by the United States in March 2022.

                </p>
                <p>Kaspersky said in 2020 that Apple had blocked access to its newly-developed parental control app as the American firm was poised to launch a similar service.

                </p>
                <p>Apple previously told AFP it "respectfully disagreed" with assessment that it had abused its market position. It appealed the decision but Russian courts upheld the ruling.

                </p>
                <p>Russia in 2021 passed legislation requiring all devices with internet access sold in the country to be equipped with approved software produced by Russian companies.

                </p>
                <p>Dubbed the "anti-Apple" law, the controversial bill was introduced in an effort to promote Russia’s tech companies but critics said it was an attempt to tighten state control over the internet.

                </p>
                <p>The list of companies included programmes made by Kaspersky.
