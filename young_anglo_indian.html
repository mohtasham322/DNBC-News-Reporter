                <p style="font-size: 15px; color: gray;">Ruchelle Barrie is trying to learn more about her family's past
                </p>
                <p><b>Ruchelle Barrie remembers feeling out of place in school.

                </b></p>
                <p>Her name was frequently spelt and pronounced incorrectly and her fluent English made her stick out among her classmates - who were more comfortable speaking Hindi or Marathi - in the Indian city of Mumbai.

                </p>
                <p>But with that spotlight came questions: Where are you from? Is your family from India? What's an Anglo-Indian?

                </p>
                <p>The last one was the toughest to answer, so she learnt to dodge it, distancing herself in public from what was a "core aspect" of her identity.

                </p>
                <p>The term Anglo-Indian commonly refers to people with British and Indian parentage. But legally, it means Indian citizens who are of European descent on their father's side - which means that their paternal ancestors could be British, French or Portuguese, reflecting the long history of colonisation in India.

                </p>
                <p>Ms Barrie, now 30, is of French lineage on her father's side and British on her mother's - she still has questions about her identity and where she really fits in.

                </p>
                <p>"But now I'm more comfortable with it and want to know more about my ancestry," she says. So she has joined a Facebook group for Anglo-Indians, where she asks questions about the community and its culture.

                </p>
                <p>Ms Barrie is among several young Anglo-Indians who are trying to learn more about their roots and preserve their community's cultural identity, which many fear is at risk of being forgotten.

                </p>
                <p>Some are researching and documenting their family's history, and rekindling ties with long-lost relatives; others are finding ways to preserve shared memories and old recipes. In the process, they are finding new ways to foster a sense of belonging within the dispersed, dwindling community.

                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 15px; color: gray;"></p>Bridget White-Kumar has written several books on Anglo-Indian cuisine
            </p>
            <p>Many are seeking to understand their own identity better by researching their family history.

            </p>
            <p>Bangalore-based Muna Beatty and her husband Michael use genealogy websites to dig out old records - like birth, death and marriage certificates - and visit military offices, churches, cemeteries and old colonial bungalows to find out where their ancestors lived, worked or were buried.

            </p>
            <p>Ms Beatty says the quest has helped them reconnect with family members across the world - they have now formed a WhatsApp group called Finding the Beattys.

            </p>
            <p>For Marcelle Britto, the exercise has helped her understand her mother's unique childhood better. Her mother, who has Irish ancestry on her father's side, had a starkly different life from hers - she grew up in a massive colonial bungalow with dozens of domestic helpers, and was invited to tea parties and ballroom dances.

            </p>
            <p>Ms Britto has managed to trace her ancestry up to the 1700s. "My mother's stories and my own mixed identity make more sense now," she says.

            </p>
            <p>Until a couple of decades ago, Mr Van Buerle says, Anglo-Indians wanted to know about their ancestry because it could help them migrate abroad. But with the community assimilating successfully in India, people aren't leaving India in the same numbers.

            </p>
            <p>"The quest to understand one's ancestry and identity is no longer motivated by a need for proof, but a need for meaning - it's an exciting journey to know more about one's self and history," he says.

            </p>

                <p style="font-size: 15px; color: gray;"></p>Cecilia Abraham's paternal grandparents at her aunt's wedding

            </p>
            <p>Hyderabad-based Cecilia Abraham, 47, runs a crowdsourced project on social media called Anglo Indian Stories, where people are encouraged to share family photographs and old memories.

            </p>
            <p>Even though she had a very "Anglo-Indian upbringing", Ms Abraham says she didn't know much about her ancestry. Her father preferred to call himself "an Indian Christian".

            </p>
            <p>"One of the stereotypes surrounding the community is that Anglo-Indians drink and party too much and are not very educated," she says. "My father didn't want us to be seen in that light."

            </p>
            <p>Contributors to the project have described their families' ties with India's railways and military and what life was like before and after independence. Some talk about the pain of having lost contact with close relatives.

            </p>
            <p>Ms Abraham hopes her project will help people take pride in their identity.

            </p>
            <p>"When we like something, we talk about it; we take care of it," she says. "And that's how things, including culture, are preserved for future generations."
