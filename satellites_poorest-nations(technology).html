                <p>DOHA: Only a third of people in the world's poorest countries can connect to the internet, the UN telecoms agency said Sunday, but low-flying satellites could bring hope to millions, especially in remote corners of Africa.

                </p>
                <p>Tech giants including Microsoft have pledged to help populations hobbled by poor internet services to "leapfrog" into an era of online connectivity, with satellites set to play a key role as rival firms send thousands of new generation transmitters into low level orbit.

                </p>
                <p>At the moment just 36% of the 1.25 billion people in the world's 46 poorest countries can plug into the internet, the International Telecommunication Union said. By comparison, more than 90% have access to the European Union.

                </p>
                <p>The ITU condemned the "staggering international connectivity gap" that it said had widened over the past decade.

                </p>
                <p>The divide has been a key complaint at a UN summit of Least Developed Countries in Doha, where UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told their leaders that "you are being left behind in the digital revolution".

                </p>
                <p>The digital dearth is particularly acute in some African countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, where barely a quarter of the population of nearly 100 million can connect.

                </p>
                <p>While internet access is easy in major DRC cities such as Kinshasa, huge rural zones and swathes of territory battled over by rival rebel groups for more than two decades are digital deserts.

                </p>
                <p>The launch of thousands of Low-Earth Orbit satellites could bring speedy change and boost African hopes, tech experts promised at the Doha summit.

                </span>
                <p>Satellite coverage will play a key role in Microsoft's vow to bring internet access to 100 million Africans by 2025, which was outlined ahead of the summit.

                </p>
                <p>Microsoft announced a first phase for five million Africans in December and last week added a commitment to cover another 20 million people.
