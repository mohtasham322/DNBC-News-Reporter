                <span class="magazine_heading_description">Former Cabinet minister Nadine Dorries (Alamy)
                </span><hr>
                <p><b>Former Cabinet minister Nadine Dorries has become the latest Conservative MP to announce she is standing down.
                </b></p>
                
                <p>Dorries, a major ally of former prime minister Boris Johnson, said after "much soul-searching" she had decided to not contest her Mid Bedfordshire seat at the next general election.

                </p>
                <p>"I love my constituents and I've loved serving them – it's been such an honour for the best part of two decades of my life," said the former culture secretary.

                </p>
                <p>Dorries made the announcement during the latest episode of Friday Night with Nadine, the show that she presents on Talk TV, which will be aired tomorrow night.

                </p>
                <p>Dorries has been a vocal critic of the move by Tory MPs to remove Johnson from 10 Downing Street last year and has publicly said he should be reinstalled as Prime Minister.

                </p>
                <p>She has also lambasted the regime of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on several occasions.

                </p>
                <p>Announcing her plan to stand down, Dorries launched another attack on the Prime Minister and his backers, saying the Conservative party faces a "terminal" defeat at the next general election, with the Tories "polling worse now than in 1997 when they were thrashed by Labour".

                </p>
                <p>Dorries said: “The elite, the faux political intellectuals, you know who I’m talking about – those who believe they know better than anyone else, bet everything on a Rishi bounce.

                </p>
                <p>"But it never came and it was never going to.

                </p>
                <p>"The party was five points behind on the day Boris was ousted. That was a poll deficit that would have burnt away like a summer's mist on a morning lawn in the heat of a general election campaign.

                </p>
                <p>“Today it’s 24 points behind. And that, my friends, could be described as terminal. It leaves the party boxed into a corner with no exit route."

                </p>
                <p>She added that the Conservative MPs who removed Johnson as Tory leader and Prime Minister last summer were already asking "who next?" and accused them of a "lack of cohesion... infighting and occasionally the sheer stupidity".

                </p>
                <p>Dorries is the 19th Conservative MP to announce they are standing down ahead of the next general election, which is expected to take place some time next year.

                </p>
