                <p>Prince Harry had not processed the death of Princess Diana until his mid-thirties, he admits.

                </p>
                <p>Speaking to his therapist, Prince Harry explicitly spoke about not being able to feel the pain of losing the former Princess of Wales.

                </p>
                <p>The Duke of Sussex pens in his book: "Most memories of my mother, I explained, with sudden and overwhelming sorrow, were gone. On the other side of the Wall. I told her about the Wall. I told her I’d spoken to Willy about my lack of memories of our mother. He’d advised me to look through photo albums, which I’d promptly done."

                </p>
                <p>He added: "Nothing. So, my mother wasn’t images, or impressions, she was mainly just a hole in my heart, and if I healed that hole, patched it up—what then? I asked if all this sounded crazy. No. We were silent. A long time."

                </p>
                <p>Harry's therapist then asked: "She asked me what I needed. Why are you here? Look, I said. What I need…is to be rid of this heaviness in my chest. I need…I need… Yes? To cry. Please. Help me cry."

                </p>
