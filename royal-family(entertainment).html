                <p>The Royal Family was once called out for their lavish lifestyle, says Prince Hary.

                </p>
                <p>An author, whose name the Duke of Sussex does not mention in his book 'Spare', called the blue blood family 'pandas.'

                </p>
                <p>He pens: "A writer many Britons admired, a writer of thick historical novels that racked up literary prizes, had penned an essay about my family, in which she said we were simply…pandas."

                </p>
                <p>Harry then reveals the reason his family was given the name, noting: "Our current royal family doesn’t have the difficulties in breeding that pandas do, but pandas and royal persons alike are expensive to conserve and ill-adapted to any modern environment. But aren’t they interesting? Aren’t they nice to look at. This panda crack always struck me as both acutely perceptive and uniquely barbarous."

                </p>
