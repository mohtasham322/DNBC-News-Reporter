                </h2>
                <p>Poor air quality for the last three months has been a cause of concern for citizens living in Indiaâ€™s
                    financial capital city - Mumbai. Its civic body, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has blamed
                    construction activity as the major cause for the rising bad air quality in the city. To suggest dust
                    control measures, BMC has formed a seven-member committee under the chairmanship of Additional
                    Municipal Commissioner (Western Suburbs) Sanjeev Kumar. As per the directions given by Municipal
                    Commissioner I S Chahal, the panel shall submit a report within seven days.
