                <p>The Metropolitan Police confirmed that they had been in contact with the Cabinet Office over potential breaches of Covid laws in Downing Street on 20 May 2020. 

                </p>
                <p>The intervention followed reports of a ‘bring your own booze’ event held in the No 10 garden when lockdown rules were in place, with an email invite sent to staff. 

                </p>
                <p>"The Metropolitan Police service is aware of widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches of the Health Protection Regulations at Downing Street on 20 May 2020 and is in contact with the Cabinet Office,” police said in a statement.

                <p>Boris Johnson admitted attending the May 2020 party in the Downing Street garden, and apologised to the House of Commons. 

                </p>
                <p>“I know that millions of people across this country have made extraordinary sacrifices over the last 18 months,” he said in a statement before that week’s Prime Ministers’ Questions.

                </p>
                <p>“I know the rage they feel with me, and with the government I lead, when they think that in Downing Street itself the rules were not being properly followed by the people who make the rules.”

                <p>Downing Street issued an apology to Buckingham Palace after it emerged that lockdown-busting gatherings had been held in No 10 on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral in 2021. It was reported that staff filled a suitcase with wine from the Strand Co-op.

                </p>
                <p>Boris Johnson did not attend either of the events.

                <p>Wakeford, who took the seat in the North West by just 402 votes at the 2019 general election, said Labour was “ready to provide an alternative government that this country can be proud of”.

                <p>In an address to the nation later that day, Boris Johnson said that “worst fears have now come true”.

                <p>“This act of wanton and reckless aggression is an attack not just on Ukraine. It is an attack on democracy and freedom in East Europe and around the world. 

                </p>
                <p>“This crisis is about the right of a free, sovereign independent European people to choose their own future, and that is a right that the UK will always defend.”

                <p>Despite calls for his resignation over the fine, Johnson committed to staying on as prime minister.

                <p>“I understand the anger that many will feel that I myself fell short when it came to observing the very rules which the government I lead had introduced to protect the public, and I accept in all sincerity that people had a right to expect better,” he said. 

                </p>
                <p>“Now I feel an even greater sense of obligation to deliver on the priorities of the British people.”
